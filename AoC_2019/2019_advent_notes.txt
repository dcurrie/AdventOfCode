--- Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation ---

Overcome some Nim syntax misunderstandings. Read the problem statement more carefully.

--- Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm ---

Implement a simple VM...
Figured out Nim `seq` and `openarray` semantics; found string.split().
After that it was easy using brute force for part 2.

--- Day 3: Crossed Wires ---

Bogged down with line segment intesection... used a general solution for "fun" despite the 
simplicity of horz. & vert. lines only. Bogged down with a logic error in part 2 (left loop 
early thinking I needed the min for each path separately despite the challenge being worded 
quite clearly). Nim documentation was good, but hard to navigate; I often knew exactly what 
I wanted but couldn't find the right module. Why isn't `zip` general?

--- Day 4: Secure Container ---

The hardest task in part 1 was figuring out Nim syntax for integer modulo and divide (it's infix 
`mod` and `div`). Part 2 took two tries because I overlooked a case that wasn't covered by the
examples: a pair followed by a larger group. That cost a couple minutes to suss out, but overall
a pretty easy day.
